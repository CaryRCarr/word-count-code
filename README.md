# word-count-code
Simple Python code for counting the number of times certain words appear in a text file.

This code uses system arguments, as listed below.

Steps for use:
When testing the functionality for finding the top three most common words, run the code using the following set-up:
wordcount.py [Convert to Lower Case: True/False] [Path to Text File]

The first system argument will convert all words to lower-case if true, allowing for identical words in different cases to be counted as a single word. The second argument will be taken as the path to the text file in question.

When testing the functionality for finding the number of times a given word shows up in the file, run the code using the following set-up:
wordcount.py [Convert to Lower Case: True/False] [Path to Text File] [Word To Be Found]

As with the top three most common words, the first system argument will convert all words, including the word being searched for, to lower-case if true, allowing for identical words in different cases to be counted as a single word. The second argument will be taken as the path to the text file in question, and the third argument will be the word to be counted in the file.
